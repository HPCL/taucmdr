Time to write as much as possible:


packages:
  *BFD from binutils <--- this seems to have trouble on Yellowstone w/ both Intel 14 and 15

  *libunwind

  *PDT

  *scorep

  *PAPI

  *macqao




types of instrumentation:

  *source: tau_compiler.sh
    ** requires recompiling
    ** requires PDT
    ** shows MPI events
    ** routine level events
    ** low level events (loops, phases, etc?)
    ** throttling
    ** exclude files from instrumentation
    ** exclude regions of code within a file

  *compiler: tau_compiler.sh
    **requires recompiling
    ** shows MPI events
    ** routine level events

  *binary:

  *Dynamic, interposition,library pre-loading: tau_exec
    ** shows MPI events
    ** throttling
    ** exclude files from instrumentation


When is BFD needed?  When is it suggested?

When is libunwind needed?  When is it suggested?
