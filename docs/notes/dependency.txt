Time to write as much as possible:


packages [set via target]:
  *BFD from binutils <--- this seems to have trouble on Yellowstone w/ both Intel 14 and 15

  *libunwind

  *PDT

  *scorep

  *PAPI

  *macqao

   these are created in the target component

target can also determine if GPUs or Xeon Phis exist


types of instrumentation: [measurement]

  *source: tau_compiler.sh
    ** requires recompiling
    ** requires PDT
    ** shows MPI events
    ** routine level events
    ** low level events (loops, phases, etc?)
    ** throttling
    ** exclude files from instrumentation
    ** exclude regions of code within a file
    ** OpenMP via the Opari
    ** use OMPT library to know how to hook up to OMP calls for tracking


  *compiler: tau_compiler.sh
    **requires recompiling
    ** shows MPI events
    ** routine level events


  *binary:

  *Dynamic, interposition,library pre-loading: tau_exec
    ** shows MPI events
    ** throttling
    ** exclude files from instrumentation
    ** Intel compilers can do this with OMPT library

application [what it uses library wise]
  -- uses mPI
 -- use openmp
 -- use pthreads
 -- cuda
 -- shmem
 -- xeon phi native
 -- xeon phi offload


When is BFD needed?  When is it suggested?

When is libunwind needed?  When is it suggested?

Requisite: required, recommended, none ->> that helps determine compatability between project components
  model itself is the fields or data structure of a abstract project
