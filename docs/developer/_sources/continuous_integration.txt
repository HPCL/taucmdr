Continuous Integration
======================

Continuous Integration (CI) tests are run on the `Travis-CI.org`_ continuous integration hosting service, which is free to open-source projects hosted on `Github.com`_.
The main settings file, ``.travis.yml``, controls the setup of the test environment on Ubuntu Linux and OS X host virtual machines (or docker containers).

More coming soon...
