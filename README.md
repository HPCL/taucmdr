TAU Commander from [ParaTools, Inc.](http://www.paratools.com/) is a production-grade performance engineering solution that makes [TAU](http://tau.uoregon.edu/) users more productive.  It presents a simple, intuitive, and systemized interface that guides users through performance engineering workflows and offers constructive feedback in case of error.  TAU Commander also enhances the performance engineer's ability to mine actionable information from the application performance data by connecting to a [suite of cloud-based data analysis, storage, visualization, and reporting services](http://www.taucommander.com/).  These analysis capabilities distinguish TAU Commander from all other offerings in the performance engineering marketplace.  

TAU Commander is especially useful for porting, developing, modernizing, benchmarking, and purchasing efforts where the intricacies of multi-layered software parallelism are difficult to intuit.  The principal components of TAU Commander are:

- An intuitive user interface for the [TAU Performance
  System](http://tau.uoregon.edu/) that simplifies the process of acquiring and displaying software performance data on a variety of computer systems.
  -  A suite of cloud-based performance data analysis, storage, visualization,
     and reporting services that enhances the performance engineer's ability to mine actionable information from software application performance data.
