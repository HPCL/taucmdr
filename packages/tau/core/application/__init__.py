"""Application data model.

:any:`Application` fully describes the application configuration to be profiled, 
including the features the application uses, e.g. OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, etc.
Each specific application **configuration** has its own application record.  
For example, if an application can operate with or without OpenMP then there 
are potentially two application records for the same application code: one 
specifying OpenMP is used and the other specifying OpenMP is not used.
