"""Target data model.

:any:`Target` fully describes the hardware and software environment that our
experiments will be performed in.  The hardware architecture, available compilers,
and system libraries are described in the target record.  There will be multiple
target records for any physical computer system since each target record uniquely
describes a specific set of system features.  For example, if both GNU and Intel
compilers are installed then there will target configurations for each compiler family.
